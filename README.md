# IV-FLuid-Level-Indicator

**Description**


I have used fluid level indicator, for a new concept/application. Mainly the circuit I have constructed is used for water level indication in water tanks/ fuel level indication in vehicles, factories, etc, but here I have applied the same principle for a new application which is not available in the market. When patients need to be on fluids continously, their IV fluid needs to be refilled at the required time without any delay. This becomes a hassle if nurses/doctor are not around. This is why I have used the same principle and applied it for IV fluid level indicator.

**MATERIAL DESCRIPTION:**


1. Bread Board – We will be working on a bread board for connections on this prototype. 

2. A 9-Volt Battery (Li-ion) – Source to produce certain voltage to the circuit. 

3. 3 LEDs – The LEDs or Light Emitting Diodes are used as level indicators. 

4. 4 BC 547 Transistors - In simple circuit of water level indicator, the BC547 transistor serves both purposes. 

5. 3 X 100 Ohm Resistors - A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. 

6. Connecting/Jumper wires – used to connect components with each other 
 
7. Buzzer - A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric . 


Its base is used to sense the top water level and also to drive the   LED connected in its collector circuit. Thus the transistor BC547 is used as sensor and LED driver transistor. 


IV FLUID SETUP- examples are Lactated ringers, 0.9% normal saline, Dextrose, blood etc.

Procedure:

1. The first Led positive lead is connected to battery positive and for glowing it, the negative lead of LED needs to be connected to batter negative pole.

2. The negative lead of led is connected to collector(load) of BC547 transistor and the eimtter pin of BC547 is connected to negative.

3. When we want to trigger the transistor we have to apply a small voltage at the transistor base pin so when the sensor probe is in IV fluid, small voltage gets on the base pin and it switches the transistor.

4. As a result the begative lead of LED gets connected to battery negative via emitter pin and LED glows 

The last probe will be a buzzer instead of a LED,hence the whole circuit works.


Conclusion 

Even to this day, with all the modern technologies in treatment available, there is still no such system where we can trust machines to attend patients and their personal needs in intensive care. Hence, we cannot depend on these existing machines to change or refill the IV fluid accurately without any delay. This provided me motivation to make this IV fluid level indicator. 
When made on a more professional stage, this can be implemented in gold wires instead of normal connecting wires to prevent corrosion of wires due to the IV fluid. This is the most simple way to make this device and could be easily afforded by hospitals.
